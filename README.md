# MemeSiteProject
The memesite is a site where you can upload and categorize pictures. As of now it is very rudimentary but pretty useful when ran as a private site using your own folders on your PC. I use it myself.

To get started with it just download the site and build your own database around it, some basic knowledge of HTML is required. More documentation in the files themselves should be added by us.

If you need any help just post up an issue.
